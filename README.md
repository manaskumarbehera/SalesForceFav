- Support partial matches and be case-insensitive.
- Allow users to search by credential name, environment, or any other relevant metadata.

The search bar should be prominently placed, and the results should update dynamically as the user types.

## 4. Import and Export Functionality

Add **import and export functionalities** to allow users to back up and restore their saved credentials. This includes:

- Exporting credentials as a JSON file, including all relevant details (e.g., credential name, environment, username, password, SSO URL, favicon color).
- Providing an import function where users can upload a JSON file to restore their credentials.
- Implementing error handling for incorrect formats or duplicate entries.

The UI should include clear instructions and feedback messages to guide users through the process.
