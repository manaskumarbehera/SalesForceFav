# SalesforceFav Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** August 16, 2024

Welcome to SalesforceFav! Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting the information you share with us. This Privacy Policy explains how SalesforceFav ("we," "us," or "our") handles your data when you use our Chrome extension ("SalesforceFav" or "the Extension").

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. Personal Information:
SalesforceFav does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information, including Salesforce credentials, usernames, passwords, or any other identifying information.

### b. Usage Data:
We do not track or log any data about your interactions with the Extension. No browsing history, login activity, or Salesforce account details are collected or stored.

### c. Favicons:
The favicons you choose or upload are stored locally on your browser and are only used for the purpose of visually identifying your Salesforce accounts. We do not have access to this data.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
Since SalesforceFav does not collect any personal or usage data, there is no information to use or share. The Extension’s primary function is to help you manage and personalize your Salesforce account favicons, and all data related to this process is managed locally on your device.

## 3. Data Security

### a. Local Storage:
All data related to your custom favicons and account preferences is stored locally on your browser. This data is never transmitted over the internet or shared with third parties.

### b. No Transmission:
As SalesforceFav does not interact with any external servers or databases, your data remains entirely on your device. We recommend keeping your browser and the Extension updated to ensure security.

## 4. Third-Party Services
SalesforceFav does not integrate with any third-party services, and no data is shared with third parties.

## 5. Your Control Over Your Data

### a. Managing Favicons:
You can change or delete your custom favicons at any time directly through the Extension's interface. This will update or remove the favicons from your local storage.

### b. Uninstallation:
If you choose to uninstall SalesforceFav, all data related to the Extension, including your custom favicons, will be removed from your browser.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any significant changes are made, we will notify you through the Extension or via the Chrome Web Store. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
